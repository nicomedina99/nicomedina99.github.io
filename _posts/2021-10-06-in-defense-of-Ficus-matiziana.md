# In defense of *Ficus matiziana*
This is about a name that has been incorrectly used in scientific literature and a reflection on scientific nomenclature. C.C. Berg in The Flora of Ecuador (2005) had already noticed that the types and descriptions of *Ficus matiziana* and *Ficus bulleneii* were very similar, and concluded that the two names referred to the same species. Following botanical conventions the correct name is the one that was published first, in this case that is *F. matiziana* published in 1946 three years before *F. bullenei*. 

This species was named in honor of Fansico Javier Matis (1774-1851) a Neogranadian (Colombian) botanist and painter. Matis’ contributions include beautiful plates with detailed anatomical illustrations in some of the first western studies of plants of the New World. Matis was also a mentor of intellectuals that built the original foundations of Colombian science.

This species is also in Panama, where the presence of the Smithsonian Institution has greatly enriched Neotropical knowledge, but even after 2005 studies still use the synonym *F. bullenei* (see paper1, paper2, paper3, etc). Up to here, I only argue that the botanical community has already agreed on how to deal with synonym names independently published, and the correct name of this species is *F. matiziana*.

However, my main frustration comes from contextualizing the name *F. bullenei*. Both names were published right after World War II, *F. matiziana* by Colombian aristocrat and botanist Armando Dugand, and *F. bullenei* by Californian botanist Ivan Murray Johnston; both authors made important contributions to botany but the link between Johnston and Panama trails to problematic history. In the original publication, Johnston dedicates the species to Brigadier General E.F. Bullene and as he literally cites <<Commanding General of the San Jose project from its inception to 1945>>. 

The San Jose project (named after San Jose Island in Panama) was part of WWII's secret chemical testing programs, there is extensive literature detailing the horrors perpetrated on this island even against their own American soldiers (link1 link2 link3...). One atrocious experiment intended to test the effects of mustard gas on the skin of men using soldiers of color as "Guinea pigs". According to Howard (1961) and Correl (1961), during WWII Johnston was called upon as a civilian to contribute with botanical knowledge in studies of <<means of defoliating tropical forests by the use of chemicals>>, but Johnston probably didn’t know the deeps of the project he praised. 
  
Species names are a human construct so they should reflect the values that we want to transmit to the following generations. Colonialism, imperialism, and war are built upon dehumanization of people; history should never be forgotten, but species names should only commemorate human’s bests, and the name *F. bullenei* is a reminder of the horrors of war (as presumably Johnston did not intend).
