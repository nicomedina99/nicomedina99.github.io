# In defense of _Ficus matiziana_

This is about a name that has been incorrectly used in scientific literature and a reflection on botanical nomenclature. C.C. Berg in The Flora of Ecuador (2005) had already noticed that the types and descriptions of _Ficus matiziana_ and _Ficus bulleneii_ were very similar, and concluded that the two names referred to the same species. Following botanical conventions the correct name is the one that was published first, in this case that is _F. matiziana_ published in 1946 three years before _F. bullenei._ 

This species was named in honor of Fansico Javier Matis (1774-1851) a Neogranadian (Colombian) botanist and painter. Matis’ contributions include beautiful plates with detailed anatomical illustrations in some of the first western studies of plants of the New World. Matis was also a mentor of intellectuals that built the original foundations of Colombian science.

This species is also in Panama, where the presence of the Smithsonian Institution has greatly enriched Neotropical knowledge, but even after 2005 studies still use the synonym _F. bullenei_ (for example Satler et al 2019 & 2020). Up to here, I only argue that the botanical community has already agreed on how to deal with synonyms independently published, and the correct name of this species is _F. matiziana._

However, my main frustration comes from contextualizing the name _F. bullenei._ Both names were published right after World War II. _F. matiziana_ by Colombian aristocrat and botanist Armando Dugand, and _F. bullenei_ by Californian botanist Ivan Murray Johnston; both authors made important contributions to botany but the link between Johnston and Panama trails to problematic history. In the original publication, Johnston dedicates the species to Brigadier General E.F. Bullene and as he literally cites <<Commanding General of the San Jose project from its inception to 1945>>. 

The San Jose project (named after San Jose Island in Panama) was part of WWII's secret chemical testing programs, there is extensive literature detailing the horrors perpetrated on this island even against their own American soldiers ([Panama: Bombs on the Beach](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2968/058004014); [Mustard gas and American race-based human experimentation in World War II](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA186516801&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=10731105&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7Ec1a9a120); [NPR report](https://www.npr.org/2015/06/22/415194765/u-s-troops-tested-by-race-in-secret-world-war-ii-chemical-experiments)). One atrocious experiment intended to test the effects of mustard gas on the skin of men using soldiers of color as “Guinea pigs”. According to Howard (1961) and Correl (1961), during WWII Johnston was called upon as a civilian to contribute with botanical knowledge in studies of <<means of defoliating tropical forests by the use of chemicals>>, but Johnston probably didn’t know the deeps of the project he praised. 

Species names are a human construct so they should reflect the values that we want to transmit to the following generations. Colonialism, imperialism, and war are built upon the dehumanization of people; history should never be forgotten, but species names should only commemorate human’s bests, and the name _F. bullenei_ is a reminder of the horrors of war (as presumably Johnston did not intend).
